# GuessTheNumber

Simple console game written in C#, where you need to guess pseudo-randomly generated number.
It differs from standard game of such kind with the fact you get message only when you are near enough of secret number without being specified whether number is lesser or greater.
Game uses graphical-like interface, where you navigate with the arrow-keys, i.e. one cannot select options via entering keys (like 'enter 1 to play game, enter q to exit').
